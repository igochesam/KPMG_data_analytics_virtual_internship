# KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Internship

I took part in the KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Internship to gain practical insight into the work done at KPMG and take advantage of an opportunity to build my skills in the area of Data Analytics.

## Introduction
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium-sized bikes & cycling accessories organisation, has approached Tony Smith (Partner) in KPMG’s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is keen to learn more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, Information and Modelling team. The project is mainly divided into three tasks. The datasets can be gotten from [here](https://cdn-assets.theforage.com/vinternship_modules/kpmg_data_analytics/KPMG_VI_New_raw_data_update_final.xlsx)

## Task 1: Data Quality Assessment
Three datasets namely Transactions, Customer Address, and Customer Demographic, have been provided. The job required is to examine the datasets and point out the data quality issues there might be, proffer possible solutions to the problem and finally, draft an email to the client to this effect. below for criteria and dimensions which you should consider.

### Solution
Here is the email [draft](https://github.com/igochesam/KPMG_data_analytics_virtual_internship/files/13237695/data_cleaning_draft.docx) containing the issues found with the datasets and the strategies to mitigate the identified issues.


## Task 2: Data Insights
Prepare a detailed approach for completing the analysis, including activities – i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting. This detailed plan needs to be presented to the client to get a sign-off. Please advise what steps you would take. 

Please ensure your PowerPoint presentation includes a detailed approach for our strategy behind each of the 3 phases including activities involved in each - i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting. This detailed plan needs to be presented to the client to get a sign-off.

### Solution
This is the [presentation](https://github.com/igochesam/KPMG_data_analytics_virtual_internship/files/13329196/Presentation1.Autosaved.pptx) containing the approach for completing the analysis.


## Task 3: Data Insights
The client is happy with the analysis plan and would like us to proceed.  After building the model we need to present our results back to the client. 

Visualisations such as interactive dashboards often help us highlight key findings and convey our ideas in a more succinct manner. A list of customers or algorithm won’t cut it with the client, we need to support our results with the use of visualisations. 

### Solution
This is the [dashboard](https://github.com/igochesam/KPMG_data_analytics_virtual_internship/assets/109409835/2f76d86d-dcd3-418b-8db9-4246d0cbce67) containing the approach for completing the analysis, done using Tableau.
